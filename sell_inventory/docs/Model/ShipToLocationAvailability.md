# ShipToLocationAvailability

## Properties
Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**quantity** | **int** | This container is used to set the total &#39;ship-to-home&#39; quantity of the inventory item that will be available for purchase through one or more published offers. This container is not immediately required, but &#39;ship-to-home&#39; quantity must be set before an offer of the inventory item can be published.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If an existing inventory item is being updated, and the &#39;ship-to-home&#39; quantity already exists for the inventory item record, this container should be included again, even if the value is not changing, or the available quantity data will be lost. | [optional]
