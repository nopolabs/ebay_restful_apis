**category_id** | **string** | The unique identifier of the primary eBay category that the inventory item is listed under. This field is always returned for published offers, but is only returned if set for unpublished offers. | [optional]

**merchant_location_key** | **string** | The unique identifier of the inventory location. This identifier is set up by the merchant when the inventory location is first created with the &lt;strong&gt;createInventoryLocation&lt;/strong&gt; call. Once this value is set for an inventory location, it can not be modified. To get more information about this inventory location, the &lt;strong&gt;getInventoryLocation&lt;/strong&gt; call can be used, passing in this value at the end of the call URI.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This field is always returned for published offers, but is only returned if set for unpublished offers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Max length&lt;/b&gt;: 36 | [optional]

**quantity_limit_per_buyer** | **int** | This field is only applicable and set if the seller wishes to set a restriction on the purchase quantity of an inventory item per seller. If this field is set by the seller for the offer, then each distinct buyer may purchase up to, but not exceed the quantity in this field. So, if this field&#39;s value is &lt;code&gt;5&lt;/code&gt;, each buyer may purchase a quantity of the inventory item between one and five, and the purchases can occur in one multiple-quantity purchase, or over multiple transactions. If a buyer attempts to purchase one or more of these products, and the cumulative quantity will take the buyer beyond the quantity limit, that buyer will be blocked from that purchase.&lt;br/&gt; | [optional]
