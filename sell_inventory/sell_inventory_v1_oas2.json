Warehouse locations are used for traditional shipping, and store locations are generally used by US merchants selling products through the In-Store Pickup program, or used by UK, Australian, and German merchants selling products through the Click and Collect program.

Upon first creating an inventory item record, only the SKU value in the call path is required. <br/><br/> In the case of replacing an existing inventory item record, the <strong>createOrReplaceInventoryItem</strong> call will do a complete replacement of the existing inventory item record, so all fields that are currently defined for the inventory item record are required in that update action, regardless of whether their values changed. So, when replacing/updating an inventory item record, it is advised that the seller run a <strong>getInventoryItem</strong> call to retrieve the full inventory item record and see all of its current values/settings before attempting to update the record. And if changes are made to an inventory item that is part of one or more active eBay listings, a successful call will automatically update these eBay listings. <br/><br/> The key information that is set with the <strong>createOrReplaceInventoryItem</strong> call include: <ul> <li>Seller-defined SKU value for the product.

It is up to sellers whether they want to create a complete inventory item group record right from the start, or sellers can provide only some information with the initial <strong>createOrReplaceInventoryItemGroup</strong> call, and then make one or more additional <strong>createOrReplaceInventoryItemGroup</strong> calls to complete the inventory item group record. Upon first creating an inventory item group record, the only required elements are  the <strong>inventoryItemGroupKey</strong> identifier in the call URI, and the members of the inventory item group specified through the <strong>variantSKUs</strong> array in the request payload. <br><br>In the case of updating/replacing an existing inventory item group, this call does a complete replacement of the existing inventory item group record, so all fields (including the member SKUs) that make up the inventory item group are required, regardless of whether their values changed. So, when replacing/updating an inventory item group record, it is advised that the seller run a <strong>getInventoryItemGroup</strong> call for that inventory item group to see all of its current values/settings/members before attempting to update the record. And if changes are made to an inventory item group that is part of a live, multiple-variation eBay listing, these changes automatically update the eBay listing. For example, if a SKU value is removed from the inventory item group, the corresponding product variation will be removed from the eBay listing as well.<br/><br/> In addition to the required inventory item group identifier and member SKUs, other key information that is set with this call include: <ul> <li>Title and description of the inventory item group. The string values provided in these fields will actually become the listing title and listing description of the listing once the first SKU of the inventory item group is published successfully</li> <li>Common aspects that inventory items in the qroup share</li> <li>Product aspects that vary within each product variation</li> <li>Links to images demonstrating the variations of the product, and these images should correspond to the product aspect that is set with the <strong>variesBy.aspectsImageVariesBy</strong> field</li> </ul> <p>In addition to the <code>authorization</code> header, which is required for all eBay REST API calls, the <strong>createOrReplaceInventoryItemGroup</strong> call also requires the <code>Content-Language</code> header, that sets the natural language that will be used in the field values of the request payload.

If the eBay listing is a motor vehicle part or accessory listing with a compatible vehicle list (<strong>ItemCompatibilityList</strong> container in Trading API's Add/Revise/Relist/Verify calls), a Product Compatibility object will be created.<br/><br/><h3>Migration Requirements</h3><br/>To be eligible for migration, the active eBay listings must meet the following requirements:<ul><li>Listing type is Fixed-Price</li><li>Listing duration is 'GTC' (Good 'til Cancelled)</li><li>The item(s) in the listings must have seller-defined SKU values associated with them, and in the case of a multiple-variation listing, each product variation must also have its own SKU value</li><li>Business Polices (Payment, Return Policy, and Shipping) must be used on the listing, as legacy payment, return policy, and shipping fields will not be accepted.

The downside to this is that the seller will be completely blocked (in APIs or My eBay) from revising these features/settings once the migration takes place:<ul><li>Best Offer settings, including the Best Offer Auto Accept and Auto Reject price thresholds</li><li>Any listing-level Buyer Requirements</li><li>Charity donations from sale proceeds</li><li>Listing Designer Template applied to the listing</li><li>Listing enhancements like a bold listing title or Gallery Plus</li><li>Listing in two categories (secondary category)</li></ul><h3>Making the Call</h3><br/>In the request payload of the <strong>bulkMigrateListings</strong> call, the seller will pass in an array of one to five eBay listing IDs (aka Item IDs). To save time and hassle, that seller should do a pre-check on each listing to make sure those listings meet the requirements to be migrated to the new Inventory model. There are no path or query parameters for this call.<br/><br/><h3>Call Response</h3><br/>If an eBay listing is migrated successfully to the new Inventory model, the following will occur:<ul><li>An Inventory Item object will be created for the item(s) in the listing, and this object will be accessible through the Inventory API</li><li>An Offer object will be created for the listing, and this object will be accessible through the Inventory API</li><li>An Inventory Location object will be created and associated with the Offer object, as an Inventory Location must be associated with a published Offer</li></ul>The response payload of the Bulk Migrate Listings call will show the results of each listing migration. These results include an HTTP status code to indicate the success or failure of each listing migration, the SKU value associated with each item, and if the migration is successful, an Offer ID value. The SKU value will be used in the Inventory API to manage the Inventory Item object, and the Offer ID value will be used in the Inventory API to manage the Offer object. Errors and/or warnings containers will be returned for each listing where an error and/or warning occurred with the attempted migration.<br/><br/>If a multiple-variation listing is successfully migrated, along with the Offer and Inventory Location objects, an Inventory Item object will be created for each product variation within the listing, and an Inventory Item Group object will also be created, grouping those variations together in the Inventory API platform. For a motor vehicle part or accessory listing that has a specified list of compatible vehicles, in addition to the Inventory Item, Inventory Location, and Offer objects that are created, a Product Compatibility object will also be created in the Inventory API platform.",
