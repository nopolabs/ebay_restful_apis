# **createChangeRequest**
> createChangeRequest($x_ebay_c_marketplace_id, $accept_language, $body)



When sellers are unable to identify an eBay catalog product on which to base their item listing, this call enables you to request that eBay update an existing product record or create a new product record that will successfully match the seller's inventory item.

### Example
```php
<?php
require_once(__DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php');

// Configure OAuth2 access token for authorization: Authorization Code
$config = Nopolabs\EBay\Commerce\Catalog\Configuration::getDefaultConfiguration()->setAccessToken('YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN');

$apiInstance = new Nopolabs\EBay\Commerce\Catalog\Api\ChangeRequestApi(
    // If you want use custom http client, pass your client which implements `GuzzleHttp\ClientInterface`.
    // This is optional, `GuzzleHttp\Client` will be used as default.
    new GuzzleHttp\Client(),
    $config
);
$x_ebay_c_marketplace_id = "x_ebay_c_marketplace_id_example"; // string | Use this header to identify the authenticated user's business context. This header is currently limited to EBAY_US, EBAY_AU, EBAY_CA, and EBAY_GB values. If not included with your request, the marketplace value defaults to EBAY_US. Note that it does not indicate a language preference or end-user location.
$accept_language = "accept_language_example"; // string | Use this header to specify the natural language in which the authenticated user desires the response.
$body = new \Nopolabs\EBay\Commerce\Catalog\Model\CreateChangeRequestPayload(); // \Nopolabs\EBay\Commerce\Catalog\Model\CreateChangeRequestPayload | Contains the full details of a specified catalog change request, including the type of request, the reason for a product update request, and the details of the new or updated product being suggested.

try {
    $apiInstance->createChangeRequest($x_ebay_c_marketplace_id, $accept_language, $body);
} catch (Exception $e) {
    echo 'Exception when calling ChangeRequestApi->createChangeRequest: ', $e->getMessage(), PHP_EOL;
}
?>
```

<?php
require_once(__DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php');

// Configure OAuth2 access token for authorization: Authorization Code
$config = Nopolabs\EBay\Commerce\Catalog\Configuration::getDefaultConfiguration()->setAccessToken('YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN');

$apiInstance = new Nopolabs\EBay\Commerce\Catalog\Api\ChangeRequestApi(
    // If you want use custom http client, pass your client which implements `GuzzleHttp\ClientInterface`.
    // This is optional, `GuzzleHttp\Client` will be used as default.
    new GuzzleHttp\Client(),
    $config
);
$x_ebay_c_marketplace_id = "x_ebay_c_marketplace_id_example"; // string | Use this header to identify the authenticated user's business context. This header is currently limited to EBAY_US, EBAY_AU, EBAY_CA, and EBAY_GB values. If not included with your request, the marketplace value defaults to EBAY_US. Note that it does not indicate a language preference or end-user location.
$change_request_id = "change_request_id_example"; // string | The unique identifier of the change request being requested. This value was originally generated by the createChangeRequest call, and is returned by the getChangeRequests call in the changeRequests.changeRequestId field.
$accept_language = "accept_language_example"; // string | Use this header to specify the natural language in which the authenticated user desires the response.

try {
    $result = $apiInstance->getChangeRequest($x_ebay_c_marketplace_id, $change_request_id, $accept_language);
    print_r($result);
} catch (Exception $e) {
    echo 'Exception when calling ChangeRequestApi->getChangeRequest: ', $e->getMessage(), PHP_EOL;
}
?>
```

# **getChangeRequests**
> \Nopolabs\EBay\Commerce\Catalog\Model\GetChangeRequestsResponse getChangeRequests($x_ebay_c_marketplace_id, $accept_language, $filter, $limit, $offset)



Use this call to search for and retrieve one or more catalog change requests that were submitted by the authenticated user based on their creation date, processing status, reference type or reference ID.

### Example
```php
<?php
require_once(__DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php');

// Configure OAuth2 access token for authorization: Authorization Code
$config = Nopolabs\EBay\Commerce\Catalog\Configuration::getDefaultConfiguration()->setAccessToken('YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN');

$apiInstance = new Nopolabs\EBay\Commerce\Catalog\Api\ChangeRequestApi(
    // If you want use custom http client, pass your client which implements `GuzzleHttp\ClientInterface`.
    // This is optional, `GuzzleHttp\Client` will be used as default.
    new GuzzleHttp\Client(),
    $config
);
$x_ebay_c_marketplace_id = "x_ebay_c_marketplace_id_example"; // string | Use this header to identify the authenticated user's business context. This header is currently limited to EBAY_US, EBAY_AU, EBAY_CA, and EBAY_GB values. If not included with your request, the marketplace value defaults to EBAY_US. Note that it does not indicate a language preference or end-user location.
$accept_language = "accept_language_example"; // string | Use this header to specify the natural language in which the authenticated user desires the response.
$filter = "filter_example"; // string | One or more comma-separated criteria for narrowing down the collection of change requests returned by this call. These criteria correspond to specific fields in the response payload. Multiple filter criteria combine to further restrict the results. The available criteria are as follows: creationDate The time period during which qualifying change requests were created (the changeRequests.creationDate field). In the URI, this is expressed as a starting timestamp, with or without an ending timestamp (in brackets). The timestamps are in ISO 8601 format, which uses the 24-hour Universal Coordinated Time (UTC) clock. For example: creationDate:[2016-02-21T08:25:43.511Z..] identifies orders created on or after the given timestamp. creationDate:[2016-02-21T08:25:43.511Z..2016-04-21T08:25:43.511Z] identifies orders created between the given timestamps, inclusive. changeRequestStatus The degree to which qualifying change requests have been resolved (the changeRequests.changeRequestStatus field). For example: changeRequestStatus:{SUBMITTED} specifies change requests that have been submitted and are being processed. changeRequestStatus:{UNDER_REVIEW|APPROVED_WITH_MODIFICATIONS} specifies change requests that are being reviewed by eBay, and change requests that have been approved, but eBay has made some modifications such as correcting typographic errors. changeRequestStatus:{REJECTED} specifies change requests that have been rejected by eBay because of a violation. referenceId The identifier of an object of the type specified by the value of the referenceType parameter. For example, if the value of referenceType is INVENTORY_ITEM, this field should contain the seller's SKU for an inventory item. If you include this without the referenceType parameter, the filter will apply to objects of any reference type with this reference ID, if specified in the change request. This parameter can take multiple values. For example: referenceId:{234242|675756} referenceType The type of object that a requested catalog change is intended to support, if specified in the change request (the changeRequests.referenceType field). For example: referenceType:{INVENTORY_ITEM} indicates that the requested change will support the completion of an inventory item, which you can then use to create an offer. referenceType:{LISTING} indicates that the requested change will support the modification of an active product listing. referenceType:{LISTING_DRAFT} indicates that the requested change will support the completion of an offer, which you can then publish as a product listing. For implementation help, refer to eBay API documentation at https://developer.ebay.com/devzone/rest/api-ref/catalog/types/FilterField.html
$limit = "limit_example"; // string | The number of change requests to return. This is the result set, a subset of the full collection of change requests that match the filter criteria of this call. Maximum: 200 Default: 50
$offset = "offset_example"; // string | The first change request to return based on its position in the returned collection of change requests. Use this parameter in conjunction with the limit parameter to control the pagination of the output. For example, if offset is set to 10 and limit is set to 10, the call retrieves change requests 11 thru 20 from the resulting collection of change requests. Note: This feature employs a zero-based list, where the first item in the list has an offset of 0. Default: 0 (zero)

try {
    $result = $apiInstance->getChangeRequests($x_ebay_c_marketplace_id, $accept_language, $filter, $limit, $offset);
    print_r($result);
} catch (Exception $e) {
    echo 'Exception when calling ChangeRequestApi->getChangeRequests: ', $e->getMessage(), PHP_EOL;
