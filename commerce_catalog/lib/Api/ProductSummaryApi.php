     * @param  string $aspect_filter An eBay category and one or more aspects of that category, with the values that can be used to narrow down the collection of products returned by this call. Aspects are product attributes that can represent different types of information for different products. Every product has aspects, but different products have different sets of aspects. You can determine appropriate values for the aspects by first submitting this call without this parameter. It will return either the productSummaries.aspects container, the refinement.aspectDistributions container, or both, depending on the value of the fieldgroups parameter in the request. The productSummaries.aspects container provides the category aspects and their values that are associated with each returned product. The refinement.aspectDistributions container provides information about the distribution of values of the set of category aspects associated with the specified categories. In both cases sellers can select from among the returned aspects to use with this parameter. Note: You can also use the Taxonomy API&#39;s getItemAspectsForCategory call to retrieve detailed information about aspects and their values that are appropriate for your selected category. The syntax for the aspect_filter parameter is as follows (on several lines for readability; categoryId is required): aspect_filter&#x3D;categoryId:category_id, aspect1:{valueA|valueB|...}, aspect2:{valueC|valueD|...},... A matching product must be within the specified category, and it must have least one of the values identified for every specified aspect. Note: Aspect names and values are case sensitive. Here is an example of an aspect_filter parameter in which 9355 is the category ID, Color is an aspect of that category, and Black and White are possible values of that aspect (on several lines for readability): GET https://api.ebay.com/commerce/catalog/v1/product_summary/search? aspect_filter&#x3D;categoryId:9355,Color:{White|Black} Here is the aspect_filter with required URL encoding and a second aspect (on several lines for readability): GET https://api.ebay.com/commerce/catalog/v1/product_summary/search? aspect_filter&#x3D;categoryId:9355,Color:%7BWhite%7CBlack%7D, Storage%20Capacity:%128GB%7C256GB%7D Note: You cannot use the aspect_filter parameter in the same call with either the gtin parameter or the mpn parameter. For implementation help, refer to eBay API documentation at https://developer.ebay.com/devzone/rest/api-ref/catalog/types/AspectFilter.html (optional)
     * @param  string $category_ids Important: Currently, only the first category_id value is accepted. One or more comma-separated category identifiers for narrowing down the collection of products returned by this call. Note: This parameter requires a valid category ID value. You can use the Taxonomy API&#39;s getCategorySuggestions call to retrieve appropriate category IDs for your product based on keywords. The syntax for this parameter is as follows: category_ids&#x3D;category_id1,category_id2,... Here is an example of a call with the category_ids parameter: GET https://api.ebay.com/commerce/catalog/v1/product_summary/search? category_ids&#x3D;178893 Note: Although all query parameters are optional, this call must include at least the q parameter, or the category_ids, gtin, or mpn parameter with a valid value. If you provide only the category_ids parameter, you cannot specify a top-level (L1) category. (optional)
     * @param  string $fieldgroups The type of information to return in the response. Important: This parameter may not produce valid results if you also provide more than one value for the category_ids parameter. It is recommended that you avoid using this combination. Valid Values: ASPECT_REFINEMENTS &amp;mdash; This returns the refinement container, which includes the category aspect and aspect value distributions that apply to the returned products. For example, if you searched for Ford Mustang, some of the category aspects might be Model Year, Exterior Color, Vehicle Mileage, and so on. Note: Aspects are category specific. FULL &amp;mdash; This returns all the refinement containers and all the matching products. This value overrides the other values, which will be ignored. MATCHING_PRODUCTS &amp;mdash; This returns summaries for all products that match the values you provide for the q and category_ids parameters. This does not affect your use of the ASPECT_REFINEMENTS value, which you can use in the same call. Code so that your app gracefully handles any future changes to this list. Default: MATCHING_PRODUCTS (optional)
     * @param  string $gtin A string consisting of one or more comma-separated Global Trade Item Numbers (GTINs) that identify products to search for. Currently the GTIN values can include EAN, ISBN, and UPC identifier types. Note: Although all query parameters are optional, this call must include at least the q parameter, or the category_ids, gtin, or mpn parameter with a valid value. You cannot use the gtin parameter in the same call with either the q parameter or the aspect_filter parameter. (optional)
     * @param  string $limit The number of product summaries to return. This is the result set, a subset of the full collection of products that match the search or filter criteria of this call. Maximum: 200 Default: 50 (optional)
     * @param  string $mpn A string consisting of one or more comma-separated Manufacturer Part Numbers (MPNs) that identify products to search for. This call will return all products that have one of the specified MPNs. MPNs are defined by manufacturers for their own products, and are therefore certain to be unique only within a given brand. However, many MPNs do turn out to be globally unique. Note: Although all query parameters are optional, this call must include at least the q parameter, or the category_ids, gtin, or mpn parameter with a valid value. You cannot use the mpn parameter in the same call with either the q parameter or the aspect_filter parameter. (optional)
     * @param  string $offset This parameter is reserved for internal or future use. (optional)
     * @param  string $q A string consisting of one or more keywords to use to search for products in the eBay catalog. Note: This call searches the following product record fields: title, description, brand, and aspects.localizedName, which do not include product IDs. Wildcard characters (e.g. *) are not allowed. The keywords are handled as follows: If the keywords are separated by a comma (e.g. iPhone,256GB), the query returns products that have iPhone AND 256GB. If the keywords are separated by a space (e.g. &amp;quot;iPhone&amp;nbsp;ipad&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;iPhone,&amp;nbsp;ipad&amp;quot;), the query ignores any commas and returns products that have iPhone OR iPad. Note: Although all query parameters are optional, this call must include at least the q parameter, or the category_ids, gtin, or mpn parameter with a valid value. You cannot use the q parameter in the same call with either the gtin parameter or the mpn parameter. (optional)

Note: You can also use the Taxonomy API&#39;s getItemAspectsForCategory call to retrieve detailed information about aspects and their values that are appropriate for your selected category. The syntax for the aspect_filter parameter is as follows (on several lines for readability; categoryId is required): aspect_filter&#x3D;categoryId:category_id, aspect1:{valueA|valueB|...}, aspect2:{valueC|valueD|...},... A matching product must be within the specified category, and it must have least one of the values identified for every specified aspect. Note: Aspect names and values are case sensitive. Here is an example of an aspect_filter parameter in which 9355 is the category ID, Color is an aspect of that category, and Black and White are possible values of that aspect (on several lines for readability): GET https://api.ebay.com/commerce/catalog/v1/product_summary/search? aspect_filter&#x3D;categoryId:9355,Color:{White|Black} Here is the aspect_filter with required URL encoding and a second aspect (on several lines for readability): GET https://api.ebay.com/commerce/catalog/v1/product_summary/search? aspect_filter&#x3D;categoryId:9355,Color:%7BWhite%7CBlack%7D, Storage%20Capacity:%128GB%7C256GB%7D Note: You cannot use the aspect_filter parameter in the same call with either the gtin parameter or the mpn parameter. For implementation help, refer to eBay API documentation at https://developer.ebay.com/devzone/rest/api-ref/catalog/types/AspectFilter.html (optional)
     * @param  string $category_ids Important: Currently, only the first category_id value is accepted. One or more comma-separated category identifiers for narrowing down the collection of products returned by this call. Note: This parameter requires a valid category ID value. You can use the Taxonomy API&#39;s getCategorySuggestions call to retrieve appropriate category IDs for your product based on keywords. The syntax for this parameter is as follows: category_ids&#x3D;category_id1,category_id2,... Here is an example of a call with the category_ids parameter: GET https://api.ebay.com/commerce/catalog/v1/product_summary/search? category_ids&#x3D;178893 Note: Although all query parameters are optional, this call must include at least the q parameter, or the category_ids, gtin, or mpn parameter with a valid value. If you provide only the category_ids parameter, you cannot specify a top-level (L1) category. (optional)
     * @param  string $fieldgroups The type of information to return in the response. Important: This parameter may not produce valid results if you also provide more than one value for the category_ids parameter. It is recommended that you avoid using this combination. Valid Values: ASPECT_REFINEMENTS &amp;mdash; This returns the refinement container, which includes the category aspect and aspect value distributions that apply to the returned products. For example, if you searched for Ford Mustang, some of the category aspects might be Model Year, Exterior Color, Vehicle Mileage, and so on. Note: Aspects are category specific. FULL &amp;mdash; This returns all the refinement containers and all the matching products. This value overrides the other values, which will be ignored. MATCHING_PRODUCTS &amp;mdash; This returns summaries for all products that match the values you provide for the q and category_ids parameters. This does not affect your use of the ASPECT_REFINEMENTS value, which you can use in the same call. Code so that your app gracefully handles any future changes to this list. Default: MATCHING_PRODUCTS (optional)
     * @param  string $gtin A string consisting of one or more comma-separated Global Trade Item Numbers (GTINs) that identify products to search for. Currently the GTIN values can include EAN, ISBN, and UPC identifier types. Note: Although all query parameters are optional, this call must include at least the q parameter, or the category_ids, gtin, or mpn parameter with a valid value. You cannot use the gtin parameter in the same call with either the q parameter or the aspect_filter parameter. (optional)
     * @param  string $limit The number of product summaries to return. This is the result set, a subset of the full collection of products that match the search or filter criteria of this call. Maximum: 200 Default: 50 (optional)
     * @param  string $mpn A string consisting of one or more comma-separated Manufacturer Part Numbers (MPNs) that identify products to search for. This call will return all products that have one of the specified MPNs. MPNs are defined by manufacturers for their own products, and are therefore certain to be unique only within a given brand. However, many MPNs do turn out to be globally unique. Note: Although all query parameters are optional, this call must include at least the q parameter, or the category_ids, gtin, or mpn parameter with a valid value. You cannot use the mpn parameter in the same call with either the q parameter or the aspect_filter parameter. (optional)
     * @param  string $offset This parameter is reserved for internal or future use. (optional)
     * @param  string $q A string consisting of one or more keywords to use to search for products in the eBay catalog. Note: This call searches the following product record fields: title, description, brand, and aspects.localizedName, which do not include product IDs. Wildcard characters (e.g. *) are not allowed. The keywords are handled as follows: If the keywords are separated by a comma (e.g. iPhone,256GB), the query returns products that have iPhone AND 256GB. If the keywords are separated by a space (e.g. &amp;quot;iPhone&amp;nbsp;ipad&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;iPhone,&amp;nbsp;ipad&amp;quot;), the query ignores any commas and returns products that have iPhone OR iPad. Note: Although all query parameters are optional, this call must include at least the q parameter, or the category_ids, gtin, or mpn parameter with a valid value. You cannot use the q parameter in the same call with either the gtin parameter or the mpn parameter. (optional)

     * @param  string $aspect_filter An eBay category and one or more aspects of that category, with the values that can be used to narrow down the collection of products returned by this call. Aspects are product attributes that can represent different types of information for different products. Every product has aspects, but different products have different sets of aspects. You can determine appropriate values for the aspects by first submitting this call without this parameter.
