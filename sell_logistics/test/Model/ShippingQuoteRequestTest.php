/**
 * Logistics API
 *
 * The Logistics API resources offer the following capabilities: shipping_quote &ndash; Consolidates into a list a set of live shipping rates, or quotes, from which you can select a rate to ship a package. shipment &ndash; Creates a &quot;shipment&quot; for the selected shipping rate. Call createShippingQuote to get a list of live shipping rates. The rates returned are all valid for a specific time window and all quoted prices are at eBay-negotiated rates. Select one of the live rates and using its associated rateId, create a &quot;shipment&quot; for the package by calling createFromShippingQuote. Creating a shipment completes an agreement, and the base service and addition shipping options are totaled into the totalShippingCost. This action also generates a shipping label that you can use to ship the package. Important! Sellers must set up a payment method via their eBay account before they can use the methods in this API to create a shipment and the associated shipping label.

// * @description This complex type defines the request body for &lt;b&gt;createShippingQuote&lt;/b&gt;. Sellers &lt;i&gt;request a quote&lt;/i&gt; for a shipment by defining the \&quot;To\&quot; and \&quot;From\&quot; addresses for the package, plus the package&#39;s size.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Carriers respond by offering up a \&quot;rate\&quot; for the service of theirs that best fits seller&#39;s needs.
