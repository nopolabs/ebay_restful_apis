If you're using the Trading API, use the rate table ID values in the RateTableDetails container of the Add/Revise/Relist calls.

Use the Metadata API method getReturnPolicies to determine which categories require you to supply a return policy for the marketplace(s) into which you list. Each policy targets a marketplaceId and categoryTypes.name combination and you can create multiple policies for each combination. A successful request returns the URI to the new policy in the Location response header and the ID for the new policy is returned in the response payload. Tip: For details on creating and using the business policies supported by the Account API, see eBay business policies. Marketplaces and locales Policy instructions can be localized by providing a locale in the Accept-Language HTTP request header. For example, the following setting displays field values from the request body in German: Accept-Language: de-DE. Target the specific locale of a marketplace that supports multiple locales using the Content-Language request header. For example, target the French locale of the Canadian marketplace by specifying the fr-CA locale for Content-Language. Likewise, target the Dutch locale of the Belgium marketplace by setting Content-Language: fr-BE. Tip: For details on headers, see HTTP request headers.",

Sellers can specify Extended Holiday Returns (as well as their regular non-holiday returns period) for chosen listings at any time during the year. The Extended Holiday Returns offer is not visible in listings until the start date of current year's holiday returns period, at which point it overrides the non-holiday returns policy. Buyers can see the Extended Holiday Returns offer in listings displayed through the purchase cutoff date and are able to return those purchases until the end date of the period. After the purchase cutoff date, the Extended Holiday Returns offer automatically disappears from the listings and the seller's non-holiday returns period reappears. Purchases made from that point on are subject to the non-holiday returns period, while purchases made before the cutoff date still have until the end of the period to return under the program.

IMPORTANT: Extended Holiday Returns is a seasonally available feature that is offered on some eBay marketplaces. To see if the feature is enabled in any given year, check the Returns on eBay page before the holiday season begins. If the feature is not enabled for the season, this field is ignored. The extended holiday returns period is defined by three dates: The start date = start of November. The purchase cutoff date = end of the year. The end date = end of January. The above dates may vary by a few days each year. Sellers are notified of the current dates on their eBay marketplace before the holiday period starts. Sellers can specify Extended Holiday Returns (as well as their regular non-holiday returns period) for chosen listings at any time during the year. The Extended Holiday Returns offer is not visible in listings until the start date of current year's holiday returns period, at which point it overrides the non-holiday returns policy. Buyers can see the Extended Holiday Returns offer in listings displayed through the purchase cutoff date and are able to return those purchases until the end date of the period. After the purchase cutoff date, the Extended Holiday Returns offer automatically disappears from the listings and the seller's non-holiday returns period reappears. Purchases made from that point on are subject to the non-holiday returns period, while purchases made before the cutoff date still have until the end of the period to return under the program. If the value of holidayReturns is false for an item, the return period specified by the returnsWithinOption field applies, regardless of the purchase date. If the item is listed with a policy of no returns, holidayReturns is automatically reset to false."
